# tsne4go
This is **tsne4go**, an implementation of the tSNE algorithm in Go.

This library is strongly inspired from [tsnejs](https://github.com/karpathy/tsnejs), an equivalent library for javascript. Its goal is to reduce the dimension of data from a high-dimension space to a low-dimension (typically 2 ou 3) one.

To learn more about it, you can download the [scientific paper describing the tSNE algorithm](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf).
